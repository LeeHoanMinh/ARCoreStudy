# ARCoreStudy
 Introduction:
 Let imagine one day, the whole world is immersed in the combination between reality and illusion.
 At that time, you can not even recognize what is real, and what is not. With the development of Augmented Reality, I believe that we can make it in the near future.
 I implemented this project not only for studying AR technology, but also to raise my curiosity about what tech can affect our life.
 
 Content:
 This project is based on a basic airplane shooting game, but now you can even play it in the real world. Your base will be built on the real-world surface, and your task is to protect it from aircraft enemies.
