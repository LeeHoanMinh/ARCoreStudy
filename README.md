# ARCoreStudy
 Introduction:
 Let imagine one day, the whole world is immersed in the combination between reality and illusion.
 You can not even recognizes what is real, and what is not.
 
 With the development of Augmented Reality, I believe that we can make it in the near future.
 
 I implemented this project not only for studying AR technology, but also to raise my curiosity about what tech can affects our life.
